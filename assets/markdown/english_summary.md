**BachNetðŸŽµ** is a productionâ€‘ready deep learning system for generating music in the style of J.S. Bach. Trained on a corpus of 382 chorales with a multiâ€‘layer, sequenceâ€‘toâ€‘sequence LSTM network, it learns both melodic patterns and temporal structures from sequences of 256 notes.

From a short seed segment of a chorale, BachNet can autoregressively compose entirely new pieces. Notes are sampled from a categorical distribution, with the degree of variation controlled by a temperature parameter.

The project also incorporates a fully inâ€‘graph TensorFlow dataâ€‘streaming pipeline, enabling efficient, onâ€‘theâ€‘fly creation and batching of training samples. This design keeps the CPU busy preparing data while the GPU remains fully utilized for model training, maximizing both throughput and performance.
