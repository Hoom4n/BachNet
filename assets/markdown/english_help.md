**How to Generate Music**
1. **Pick a seed:** Use a few seconds of an existing chorale from the validation set (unseen by the model) as the initial seed.  
2. **Control randomness:** Adjust the **Hotness slider**â€”higher values produce more diverse outputs, lower values are more conservative.  
3. **Adjust lengths:** Set the **seed length** for initial context and the **generated length** for output duration.
